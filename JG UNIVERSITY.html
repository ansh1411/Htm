<h2>BCA Course: Career Prospects</h2>
<p>The IT industry is growing rapidly and with this, the demand for BCA graduates, too, is increasing every passing day. After obtaining a BCA degree, students can find lucrative job opportunities in leading IT companies such as Oracle, IBM, Infosys, and Wipro. Some of the roles that one can bag after completing a BCA program is that of a System engineer, software tester, junior programmer, web developer, system administrator, software developer, etc.

BCA graduates are not only recruited by the private sector but also by public sector organizations. Government organizations like the Indian Air Force(IAF), Indian Army, and Indian Navy also hire a large bunch of computer professionals for their IT departments.

As far as the salary is concerned, a fresher working for a leading MNC might get a salary ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 40,000 per month. However, it was reported that IT giants like Facebook, Microsoft, etc pay a six-figure salary to a fresh graduate.
